#-------------------------------Packages------------------------------
#Packages are like folders in python where we have libraries(modules) are there.
#like we have python folder and inside that we have all classes of python files similaryl inside python language there is pavkage folder, where all python library file are stored.

#---------------------------------Libraries------------------
#Libraries are inbuilt python files inside the python language where class and functions are stored. 
# we can use these functions in our code to make things quicker. Wehave libraries for everything here in python language eg : gaming library, software library, ai library etc...

#--------------------------------How to use the libraries(modules)------------
#Three ways to import libraries -
#1. import libraryname - this will import all functions from the library. 
#how tu use functions here : libraryname.functioname()

#2. from libraryname import * - this imports and functions
#how to use functions : functioname()

#3. from libraryname import functioname - It will import only that function which we want to use it.
#How to use it : libraryname.functioname()

#-----------------------How to connect two python files----------------
#first create function in one python file and code in thta.
#import that file in second python file
# call the function in second file.

from s import sum
#from filename import functioname

#call function
sum()

#this allows to use code of one file to other. only condition is that code should inside function so that we can call the function.
